# Three In One

> **UPDATE:** This is my first Android project that I posted on GitHub, so its architecture is not good and has a bunch of spaghetti code. Check out [Three In One Compose MVVM](https://github.com/bbor98/three-in-one-compose-mvvm) for the rewritten version of this project, which is built with the modern UI toolkit Jetpack Compose, and implements the MVVM design pattern.

Calculator, unit converter and timer in one app, written in Kotlin.
